panel
compare ems vs ode
compare em vs ae? where to find data for spread
use gdp growth or gdp?
proxy for market exposure = months of reserves?
log spreads data

both gdp and inflation - depends on how economy overall is doing
depends on what happens to exchange rate
riskiness of buying eme bonds

reserves/gdp not really about exposure but how well country can recover form external shock, including capital flow reversal

look at literature - nothing super classic
some combination

challenge - getting good data from a/e to em - itself makes getting data - quarterly is challenging from some em - even harder for ode - ideal world - would be great to have panel of 15-20 ems

or within same reg would be dummy for ems vs odes - could be challenging

fill out group of 23-25 ems expand
differences across ems
asian vs latAm
lower middle/upper income
open to global finance
ems = more of market

20 - find 2-3 characteristics to split and see if differences

explanatory - robustness data
policy interest rate/ffr
robustness test instead of ffr
use 10 yr rate of us
us spreads
have implications of financial conditions in the us
10yr
10-ffr spread

vix - measure of uncertainty based on chicago board of inclined
easy to find - when people see problems in financial markets - pull money out of riskier to safer

difficulty: execute well
getting enough data to make some reasonably precise and enough coeff
once you've got basic regs set up
then play around after
